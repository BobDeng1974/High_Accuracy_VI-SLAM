\acp{UAV} require accurate pose estimates with low latency in order to achieve 
a robust and stable flight behavior. However, due to the power and payload 
restrictions 
of aerial platforms, state estimation algorithms must provide these qualities 
under computational constraints. Monocular \ac{VIO} systems, consisting 
of a camera and an \ac{IMU}, can satisfy these constraints and form the minimum 
sensor suite for 
metric 6 \ac{DoF} pose estimation.  \\

In this work, we propose an accurate keyframe based monocular \ac{VIO} pipeline 
for onboard state estimation of \acp{UAV}. The publicly available \ac{VI} 
\ac{SLAM} system VINS-Mono is therefore adapted. The performance of the 
\ac{VIO} pipeline is evaluated for different parameter settings. Based on these 
evaluations, we propose a \ac{VIO} pipeline running in real-time while only 
exhibiting a little loss in accuracy compared to the default implementation 
of VINS-Mono.\\

The proposed \ac{VIO} pipeline is extensively tested on all sequences of the 
EuRoC dataset. Furthermore, the real-time applicability is confirmed by 
deploying and running the \ac{VIO} pipeline on a real \ac{UAV}.
